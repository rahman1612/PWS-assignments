It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. In object-oriented programming (OOP), abstraction is achieved through the use of classes, where objects encapsulate data and behavior, providing a simplified interface for interacting with them."

    "Answer:\n",
    "In composition, \"has-a\" relationships represent the relationship between a complex object (e.g., a class) and its components. For example, a car \"has-a\" engine, a playlist \"has-a\" list of songs, etc. These relationships allow the complex object to use functionalities provided by its components, leading to modular and flexible design of software systems."
